Over $2 billion has been raised using the Kickstarter, but not every project are success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.

The goal of this project is to analyze a database of 4000 past projects from Kickstarter in order to uncover any hidden trends. Conditional formatting, formula, and pivot table are used in this project.
